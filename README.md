# __TM ROS Driver__

## __1. Overview__

Techman Robot is a state-of-the-art production tool that is highly compatible and flexible to collaboration between human and machine. The Robot Operating System (ROS) provides abundant libraries and tools which can be utilized to reduce the cost of trivial development software tool and build robot applications without struggling. Our TM ROS driver provides nodes for communication with Techman Robot controllers, data including robot states, images from the eye-in-hand camera and URDF models for various robot arms via _TMflow_.

## __2. Feature__

This driver is for <u>**ROS2 Dashing**</u> version.<br/>
To use the driver, make sure your ROS PC is installed correctly.<br/>
If the user want to know how to use the ROS1 driver, please visit the [TM ROS1 driver](https://github.com/TechmanRobotInc/tmr_ros1) website or directly click the __TM ROS driver version__ listed in the table below.<br/>

Note1: The two current master branches are ROS1 Melodic and ROS2 Foxy.<br/>
Note2: The tutorial that follows mentioned how to build a ROS environment on Ubuntu by sourcing is to take the ROS installed through the Debian packages as an example.<br/>


### __ROS2 Driver__

The driver for ROS2 publishes identical topics and provides identical services as [TM ROS1 version](https://github.com/TechmanRobotInc/tmr_ros1).<br/>
This driver uses _ROS2 composition_, there are two nodes in the identical process:
one node publishes topics while the other node sets up service servers.

### __Installation__
Just clone the TM ROS driver of git repository into your working directory and then built it.<br/>
The user can directly refer to the chapters introduced in the following text: steps 1 to 4 of __&sect; Usage with demo code & driver__.<br/>


## __3. Usage__
After installing the correct ROS2 version of the computer, the next step is to ensure that your hardware, control computer, and TM Robot are all properly configured to communicate with each other. See below to make sure the network settings on your computer are correct, the TM Robot's operating software (__TMflow__) network settings are ready and the __Listen node__ is running.<br/>

### &sect; __TMflow Listen node setup__
> The __Listen node__: a socket server can be established and be connected with ROS by an external device to communicate according to the [defined protocol](https://assets.omron.eu/downloads/manual/en/v1/i848_tm_expression_editor_and_listen_node_reference_manual_en.pdf). The user can make the robot communicate with the user's ROS (remote) computer equipment through a wired network, when all the network parameters in the _Network setting_ are set.<br/>
>
> 1. Create a _Listen task_ of flow project of __TMflow__ software, and then drag the __Listen node__ from the _nodes menu_ onto the project flow, as shown below.
> [![1](figures/1.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuKE2wVNn5Y)
>
> 2. Set the `Network` settings: mouse-click to enter the page of __System &rArr; Network__ in order.  
Example: Set the Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 and IP address 192.168.10.2  
**Note**: Set the network mask, and the communication with the TM Robot must be in the set domain.  
> ![2](figures/2.png)
>
> 3. Set the __Ethernet Slave__ `Data Table Setting` item: mouse-click to enter the page of __Setting &rArr; Connection &rArr; Ethernet Slave__ in order.  
We recommend _one easy method_ <sup>1</sup> to set the __Ethernet Slave__ `Data Table setting` is to directly import the software package.  
 <sup>1</sup> See [TM ROS Driver vs TMflow software Usage : Import Data Table Setting](https://github.com/TechmanRobotInc/TM_Export).  
 Or the previously provided method as follows:  (Note: TMflow software version changes may have slightly different settings.)  
The user can manually click the `Data Table Setting` <sup>2</sup> item and check the following boxes as item _predefined_ <sup>3</sup> to receive/send specific data: 
>
>       - [x] Robot_Error
>       - [x] Project_Run
>       - [x] Project_Pause

>       - [x] Joint_Torque
>       - [x] Project_Speed
>       - [x] MA_Mode
>       - [x] Robot Light
>       - [x] Ctrl_DO0~DO7
>       - [x] Ctrl_DI0~DI7
>       - [x] Ctrl_AO0
>       - [x] Ctrl_AI0~AI1
>       - [x] END_DO0~DO3
>       - [x] END_DI0~DI2
>       - [x] END_AI0
>
>    <sup>2</sup> <u>Turn off</u> Ethernet Slave. Let "STATUS:   __Disable__" displayed on Ethernet Slave setting page, then click `Data Table Setting` to enter the next page for related settings.  
>    <sup>3</sup> The checked items listed above must <u>all</u> be selected for TM ROS setting.
>
>    When you need to check more about the maximum, minimum, average calculation properties of joint torque, the _three checked items_ <sup>4</sup> listed below can be checked individually or all of them, please leave them unchecked when not in use.
>
>       - [ ] Joint_Torque_Average
>       - [ ] Joint_Torque_Min
>       - [ ] Joint_Torque_Max
>
>    <sup>4</sup> This function requires <u>TMflow 1.84 or later</u> versions to support.
>
> 4. Enable the __Ethernet Slave__ settings: mouse-click to enable or disable TM Ethernet Slave. Once enabled, the robot establish a Socket server to send the robot status and data to the connected clients and permissions to access specific robot data.<br/>
> Mouse-click to enable the `Ethernet Slave` setting and let `STATUS:` &rArr; __`Enable`__. 
>       ![2](figures/3.png)
>
> 5. Press the Play/Pause Button on the Robot Stick to start running this _Listen task_ project.
>


###  &sect; __Remote connection to TM ROBOT__
> Static IP of remote connection network settings through the wired network.<br/> 
>
> 1. Set the wired network of the user's (remote) Ubuntu computer by mouse-click on the top right of the desktop &rArr; Click on "__Wired Settings__" &rArr; Click on the gear icon &rArr; In the IPv4 feature options, click on "Manual" in order.<br/> 
> ![user_remote_network_settings](figures/user_remote_network_settings.png)
> 2. Set the Static IP settings: where the IP address is fixed for the first three yards same as the previous setting 192.168.10, last yards 3-254 machine numbers are available. (Because _TM ROBOT_, you have been set to 192.168.10.2)<br/> 
> Example: Set the Netmask: 255.255.255.0 and IP address 192.168.10.30 <br/> 
> ![user_remote_IP_example](figures/user_remote_IP_example.png)
> 3. Check Internet connection: start a terminal to test the connectivity with the target host _TM ROBOT_, by typing ping 192.168.10.2
> ![ping_target_host.png](figures/ping_target_host.png)
>> :bulb: **Tip**: Remember to reconfigure the network settings due to <u>static IP changes</u> or <u>replacement of the ROS control PC</u>.<br/>
>> As mentioned above, a valuable debugging tool is your operating system's <u>ping</u> command. If nothing appears to happen or an error is thrown, the robot cannot be accessed from your computer. Please go back to the top of this chapter and re-operate in the order of instructions.<br/>
>> If you are an experienced user, you may just need to <u>turn off</u> &rArr; <u>turn on</u> the gear icon of "__Wired Settings__" on your computer or to <u>turn off</u> &rArr; <u>turn on</u> the "__Ethernet Slave Data Table__" setting of the robot to reconfigure the hardware settings.<br/>

> __ROS2 driver usage__
> 
> After the user has set up the ROS2 environment (example : [Debian packages for ROS 2 Dashing](https://docs.ros.org/en/dashing/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)) and built the TM driver based on the specific workspace, please enter your workspace `<workspace>` by launching the terminal, and remember to make the workspace visible to ROS. 
>
>
> ```bash
> source /opt/ros/dashing/setup.bash
> cd <workspace>
> source ./install/setup.bash
> ```
> :bulb: Do you prepare the __TM Robot__ ready ? Make sure that TM Robot's operating software (__TMflow__) network settings are ready and the __Listen node__ is running. 
> 
> Then, run the driver to maintain the connection with TM Robot by typing 
>
>```bash
> ros2 run tm_driver tm_driver <robot_ip_address>
>```
> Example :``ros2 run tm_driver tm_driver 192.168.10.2``, if the <robot_ip_address> is 192.168.10.2
>
> Now, the user can use a new terminal to run each ROS node or command, but don't forget to source the correct setup shell files as starting a new terminal.

> __Usage with MoveIt2 (Tentative)__ 
>
> See [Moveit2 release Versions](https://moveit.ros.org/#release-versions).<br/>

> 1. Type to create a root workspace directory by starting a terminal: For example,  ``tmdriver_ws`` or ``catkin_ws``, then type to change current directory into the workspace directory path.<br/>
``mkdir ~/tmdriver_ws``<br/>
``cd ~/tmdriver_ws``<br/>
> 2. Clone the the TM driver of git repository into the current directory by typing<br/>
``git clone https://github.com/TechmanRobotInc/tmr_ros2.git -b dashing-devel``<br/>
or<br/>
``git clone -b dashing-devel https://github.com/TechmanRobotInc/tmr_ros2.git``<br/>
> 3. After the download done, rename the download folder ``tmr_ros2``(or ``tmr_ros2-dashing-devel``) to ``src`` by typing<br/>
``mv tmr_ros2 src``<br/>  (or right-click on the download folder, select "Rename...")<br/>
> 4. At the workspace directory to build the download packages and source 'setup.bash' in this workspace to make the worksapce visible to ROS.<br/>
**Note**: Do you set ``source /opt/ros/dashing/setup.bash`` ready? Make sure to obtain the correct setup file according to your workspace hierarchy, and then type the following below to compile.<br/>
``colcon build``<br/>
``source ./install/setup.bash``<br/>
> 5. In a new terminal: Source setup.bash in the workspace path and run the driver to connect to TM Robot by typing<br/>
``source ./install/setup.bash``<br/>
``ros2 run tm_driver tm_driver <robot_ip_address>``<br/>
The <robot_ip_address> is the IP address of the TM Robot, the user can get it through TM Flow, for example 192.168.10.2<br/>
> 6. In another new terminal: Source setup.bash in the workspace path and type specific demo node function which the user want to study for applications. For example: the user select to run demo_set_io, the user can type<br/>
``source ./install/setup.bash``<br/>
``ros2 run demo demo_set_io``<br/>

## __6. TM GUI debugging and demonstration__
This chapter describes a simplified GUI for displaying tm_driver connection status, sct, sta, svr messages, and robot status. The user can optionally install the _ui_for_debug_and_demo_ package to aid in viewing messages between the driver and the robot through the GUI display. If the driver connection fails, the user can also try to send a reconnect command on this GUI for debugging.


### &sect; GUI Debugging description
> * If the user forgets to run the TM ROS driver, the user will see all the controlled label items of the GUI are displayed as "NaN".<br/>
> * The user can click "``Quit_GUI``" button or click the "``x``" close button in the upper right corner to close this GUI.<br/>
> * If "``Ethernet``" and "``Listen Node``" connection display are "on", it means that ROS SvrClient and SctClient are successfully connected.<br/>
> * If "``Ethernet``" connection display is is "off", the user should check whether the TM Robot has been started or whether the network settings are correct.<br/>
> * If "``Listen Node``" connection is "off", the user should check whether the task project is running.<br/>
> :bulb: If "``Listen Node``" connection is interrupted as "``Project_Run``" is stopped, the "``Listen Node``" connection will be "off". <br/>
> * If both "``Ethernet``" and "``Listen Node``" connection display  are "on", but the "``Robot_Link``" is false or "``Robot_Error``" is true; this means the robot is working abnormally, or maybe the ESTOP button was pressed or or some kind of protection or error <sup>1</sup> occurred. Therefore, when the user sends a move script command at this time, it will not work.<br/> 
> <sup>1</sup> For more detailed information, please refer to the TM Robot User Guide.<br/> 
> * The user can use the self-developed script to read/write project data through communication protocols to control the TM Robot. If it does not work properly, the user can quickly determine whether there is a communication error code by viewing the "``Response ROS Node Status``" display.<br/>
> * When the user sends a command or clicks DO0 Ctrl "``H/L``" button of Control_Box, the user also can see the response message <sup>2</sup> embedded in the "``Robot Response``" item view.<br/>
> <sup>2</sup> For details of this item, please refer to __SctResponse.msg__, __StaResponse.msg__ and __SvrResponse.msg__ of TM ROS driver code.<br/>
> * The user can click "``clear``" button to clear the old response message.<br/>
> :bulb: If "``Ethernet``" connection is interrupted, the display of most controlled label items in the GUI will be displayed as "NaN" and the robot feedback state will remain the last state and become invalid.<br/>
